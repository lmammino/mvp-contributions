# mvp-contributions

CLI tool to review and submit your Microsoft MVP contributions

**Status**: **Beta quality** (manually tested, bugs are expected)


## Rationale

The MVP website is quite slow (yup, indeed Microsoft... ðŸ¤·) so it's tedious to submit a lot of stuff by hand. This tool should be able to automate most of the hard work.

It also provide convenience commands to delete entries and deduplicate them.


## Requirements

This tool requires a **modern version of Node.js (18+)**


## Authentication

Go to your browser of choice and head to [mvp.microsoft.com](https://mvp.microsoft.com/). Do a login. Inspect your cookies and copy the value for the cookie `.AspNet.Cookies`.


## Usage

You can use this tool with `npx` or install it locally.

### `npx` usage

Just run:

```bash
npx mvp-contributions --help
```

### Local installation

Install the tool locally with

```bash
npm i -g mvp-contributions
```

Then you can just run:

```bash
mvp-contributions --help
```


### Available commands

These are the commands currently supported by the tool

- `list [options]`: List submitted contributions (**default command**)
- `delete [options] <contributionId...>`: Deletes one or more contributions by contribution by ID
- `dedup [options]`: Deletes duplicated contributions
- `submit [options] [filepath]`: Submit new contributions from contributions YAML file
- `help [command]`: display help for command

All commands (except `help`) requires you to have a valid session token. This token can be passed either through the `-c` flag or by setting the environment variable `MVP_COOKIE` (recommended).

To get a valid session token, go to <https://mvp.microsoft.com/>. Perform a login and then inspect the page with your browser developer tools. Check out the cookies (_Application_ tab in Chrome) and copy the value for the `.AspNet.Cookies` cookie.

#### Example

If your `.AspNet.Cookies` value is `etzEL73OjWhpwayx...` (in reality it will be much longer than this), then you can do:

```bash
export MVP_COOKIE="etzEL73OjWhpwayx..."
mvp-contributions list
```

or

```bash
mvp-contributions -c "etzEL73OjWhpwayx..." list
```


## Submitting content from YAML files

The goal of this project is to be able to come up with ways of fetching all the content activities from one or more sources and convert them to the expected YAML contribution format.

Some examples are available on how you might be able to fetch and convert data from various sources:

  - [YouTube videos from a channel](/docs/automation/youtube.md)


Feel free to submit your examples here.


## Schema

Your `content.yml` file needs to follow a very specific schema.

The list of entries should be an array and every entry must have 2 fields: `type` (`string`) and `props` (`object`).

The `props` object will have a different schema depending on the selected type.

Here you can find the list of all the available types (pointing to their schema file in Zod):

- [`Article`](/src/schemas/Article.ts)
- [`BlogWebsitePost`](/src/schemas/BlogWebsitePost.ts)
- [`BookAuthor`](/src/schemas/BookAuthor.ts)
- [`BookCoauthor`](/src/schemas/BookCoauthor.ts)
- [`ConferenceStaffing`](/src/schemas/ConferenceStaffing.ts)
- [`DocsMicrosoftComContribution`](/src/schemas/DocsMicrosoftComContribution.ts)
- [`ForumModerator`](/src/schemas/ForumModerator.ts)
- [`ForumParticipation`](/src/schemas/ForumParticipation.ts)
- [`ForumParticipationMicrosoft`](/src/schemas/ForumParticipationMicrosoft.ts)
- [`Mentorship`](/src/schemas/Mentorship.ts)
- [`MicrosoftOpenSource`](/src/schemas/MicrosoftOpenSource.ts)
- [`NonMicrosoftOpenSource`](/src/schemas/NonMicrosoftOpenSource.ts)
- [`OrganizerConference`](/src/schemas/OrganizerConference.ts)
- [`OrganizerUserGroup`](/src/schemas/OrganizerUserGroup.ts)
- [`Other`](/src/schemas/Other.ts)
- [`ProductGroupFeedback`](/src/schemas/ProductGroupFeedback.ts)
- [`SampleCode`](/src/schemas/SampleCode.ts)
- [`SiteOwner`](/src/schemas/SiteOwner.ts)
- [`SpeakingConference`](/src/schemas/SpeakingConference.ts)
- [`SpeakingUserGroup`](/src/schemas/SpeakingUserGroup.ts)
- [`TechnicalSocialMedia`](/src/schemas/TechnicalSocialMedia.ts)
- [`TranslationReview`](/src/schemas/TranslationReview.ts)
- [`VideoWebcastPodcast`](/src/schemas/VideoWebcastPodcast.ts)
- [`WorkshopVolunteerProctor`](/src/schemas/WorkshopVolunteerProctor.ts)


Note tha the [`contributions.yml`](/contributions.yml) committed in this repository contains some commented examples that you can use as a reference.


## Future improvement ideas

- Better testing (no testing right now... confused_john_travolta.gif)
- Support content files in JS/TS (to have a better authoring experience with autocompletion and type checking)
- Detection of expired sessions (it generally lasts 1 hour)
- Avoid submit duplicated content (fetch all contente first and deduplicate on insertion)
